Stuff to do at all times:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- grep for all the FIXME's and '#if 0' and find those that might be
  important, add what you find to this TODO

Roadmap for 0.8.0
=================

* finish/test SDL2 port

  - OpenGL renderer is broken
    -> resize doesn't work
  - Delta renderer is broken
    -> doesn't work correctly at all, can't use SDLFramebuffer any
       more due to Renderer
    -> see SDL_GetWindowSurface()
           SDL_UpdateWindowSurfaceRects()
  - some sound effects are broken -> convert to other format bit-depth, etc.
  - fade-in/out is glitchy -> rewrite with SDL_SetRenderTarget()
  - fullscreen doesn't work
  - add GameController support


Roadmap for 0.7.5
=================

* add option for demo recording to option menu


Editor
======

* get rid of time completely? maybe not, but don't use it in any of the official levels

* z-pos is not taken into account when raise/lower objects, need to
  sort object list by z-pos

* display help text when pressing F1

* document all new keyboard shortcuts

Roadmap for Pingus 0.8.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* use better checksum algorithm (sha1, md5, etc.)

* save checksum with savegame

[ERROR] Resource::load_surface(): exits/sortie_anim: can't load animated sprite as surface
[ERROR] Resource::load_surface(): exits/space: can't load animated sprite as surface
[ERROR] Resource::load_surface(): textures/anim_fire: can't load animated sprite as surface

* display keyboard shortcuts in the GUI (a little tricky with remapable keys)

* climber right animation is the wrong way around

* add priority to levelsets that can be used to sort them

* give better error message when datadir is not set

* check data/themes/ for any useful stuff


Code Cleanup
============

* add check for OpenGL

* banish Vector3f from the source code, along with float

* reduce global variables

* make pingu.hpp use int not float

* namespaces need some cleanup, most names are very ugly and
  capitalized, get rid of namespace unless obsolutely needed


Cleanup engine/ from pingus/ dependencies
=========================================

* pingus/fps_counter.hpp move to engine (needs pingus/fonts.hpp, could
  be solved by either setting the Font manually or having a dedicated
  engine/system font)

* pingus/gexttext.hpp used by Screenshot, solvable by moving text output to
  pingus/

* pingus/global_event.hpp used by SDLDriver, could be solved with boost::signal

* pingus/globals.hpp needs cleanup

* pingus/path_manager.hpp used in sound, could be replaced with Pathname

* pingus/resource.hpp used by Sprite

* DebugFlags are currently used for text output as well as visual
  hints, should be changed, maybe use maintainer_mode instead


Beta Testing
============

* check that all levels (including playable/, testing/ and wip/)
  behave the same as in Pingus0.6

* check that those things that differ between Pingus0.6 and PingusSDL
  are changed for the better

* check that all translations are up to date

* find the places where translation breaks the GUI (i.e. fonts running
  over GUI elements)

* check long-term play, play the game for an hour and check that
  its not degrading (obvious memory leak or stuff like that)


OLPC Issues
===========

* performance goes down a lot with many Pingus -> Benchmark if its the
  drawing or collision detection (likely to many rectangles -> go
  Microtile array or make RectMerger suck in rects that are close together)

* music does make things very slow and then just stops working

* cursor and icons are too small

* maybe bigger font

* 1920x1200 vs 1200x900 -> height 900 close to 1200, do magic so that
  we don't have vertical scrolling for small levels

* editor refreshes too much

* doesn't have FXX keys in non-fullscreen mode


"Important" Stuff and Random Notes:
===================================

* map middle button to pause

* add button bar to the demo recorder, so that used action are visible

* ChoiceBox needs a way to carry user data for items

* check that all data is overridable/addable by modifying ~/.pingus/ (levelsets seem missing)

* Valgrind results:

==11421==

* CollisionMask cleanup

* add "Save Demo" to the result screen

* add "Replay" to the result screen

* animate the flag or remove it for single-player

* playfield scrolling should be float

* Repaint Exit panel

* split Pingus into base and extra user contributed content

* intro/end story and credits are not properly displayed currently

* do SurfaceButton with signals

* toggle buttons for the editor toolbar would be good
                             _________
* replace eraser-abort with ( <- Back ) button

* drawing context defaults to display::get_width/height, need to adjust that

* clicking while the screen changes is weird

* fullscreen must use a different size then the current window size (round to nearest 'normal' resolution or so)

* input recording in the ScreenManager can't work when the underlying
  savegame or screensize is different, having assert() or so to catch
  that would be nice

* ScreenManager::fade_over should be integrated into
  ScreenManager::update, so that the mainloop is never left

* add alternative fullscreen, screenshot and print-fps shortcuts for the OLPC, which doesn't have Fxx keys
  Ctrl-f -> fullscreen, Ctrl-s screenshot, Ctrl->p printfps

* add WorldObjs that provide hint to the solution

* remove default_screen_width/height, doesn't serve any purpose and is abused in a few places, same for screen_width/height

* How to handle clipping? In DeltaFramebuffer? -> 1) do it via srcrect? 2) make it a DrawOp?

* DeltaFramebuffer issues: clipping not yet implemented, particle effects are slow (to many small rectangles)

* Integrade Input-Demo recording somewhat better, like with command line switch

* Display a note when maintainer mode is active and display what
  keyboard shortcuts are available, move cheats into maintainer mode

* rewrite config file handling

* change cursor to cross with arrows when scrolling

* make "--language help" work

* the ObjectSelector in the editor is eating CPU cycles like crazy due
  to lack of clipping, minimap is also eating plenty of CPU due to its high object count

* Thumbnail loading is slow (likely .png overhead)

* do not keep software backstore for MapTiles, instead record the list of surfaces needed to generate it

* keep statistic on allocated Surfaces and FramebufferSurfaces

* remove pingus_debug_flags or find some use for it

* make a more powerfull liquid type that automatically aligns itself to the bottom level border

* datasets: core/, base/, add-on/ ?

* StatManager and new Config stuff should share code

* reduce the amount of new/delete's

* StartScreen has high CPU usage in delta mode (Diff to blame!)

* Remove support for line drawing

* forest level shows bug in DeltaRenderer


New Features
============

* split screen multiplayer

* keep highscores for levels (number saved and stuff like that)

* add clickable WorldObjs, that can be triggered by the user, not by a
  Pingu


Wishlist:
=========

* levelset list should resize on window resize

* particle pingu explosions are rects, should be circles
  (Vel(rand()%10, rand()%10) vs Vel(angle, length))

* Change current pause/forward behaviour:

  - add VCR like effect for fast forward

  - add slow motion button (dead, turtle, pingu, rabbit)

* move time into pingus counter

* make option menu accessible from in-game (top/left corner)


Animation and graphic issues:
=============================

* convert all Pingu animations to a proper indexed format so that
  palette swap can be used in multiplayer

* proper waiter animation

* repaint pause and fast-forward button

* use transparent action buttons unless fast-mode is used

* add round corners to the minimap

* allow sprites as background (para parameter from hotspots?)

* redesign main menu

* animate the exit flag

* rework the UI, either go glas-like or use the blackbord style 

* X-Mas theme needs some more polish, to be done before X-Mas '08

* create jumper animation


Bugs:
=====

* GroundMap tiles are currently RGBA, while in reality they are just
  RGB with a colorkey, room for optimization

* file parsing easily crashes or asserts on incorrect files

* Translation issues:

 - The suffix showing which extra skill a Pingus has (e.g. [f] for Floater or
   [c] for Climber). (will be fixed by climber gfx)

 - b) The big sign on the 'Tutorial Island' image

* basher follows down slopes (feature?)

* paint climber


Unsorted:
=========

* Font::draw() origin only works properly for left, right and center, breaks with multiline text

* implement xschema-like language to check for syntax errors in the level files (partly done, needs documentation and proper integration)

* trap in one tutorial level with two exits is in background, should
  be foreground (???)

* Wiimote support (libcwiid)

* do we need z-pos for anything or does implicit object position serve
  the same purpose? Problem: Groundpieces all have the same z-level,
  the editor doesn't handle that and allows insertions inbetween

* pregenerate thumbnails for the editor, generating them takes to long (thumbnail loading takes long as well, need pack format)


Roadmap for Pingus 0.7.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features:
=============

* implement option menu (already started, not all options work yet)

* add cheats: all actions, unlimited actions, skip level, these must
  be triggerable via maintainer-mode, not via commandline switch

* CollisionMask can't handle RGBA images and likely shouldn't (due to
  them being animated and stuff like that), we however don't have
  seperate colmask for those images

* test wall-jump: maybe make it smaller then a normal jump

* make climber attach to wall after jump


Bugs:
=====

* resource system needs a rewrite/implementation

* StringFormat does line breaking TeX-style, but that isn't useful
  with the current s-expr format, which can handle explicit line
  breaks just fine


Wishlist Stuff:
===============

* Liquids/water is 32, others are 64, this is causing trouble with the
  collision map


Undecided stuff:
================

* implemented input/ComboButton for Shift+Tab combinations

* add something like FileReader::must_read_int() for cases where a
  value isn't optional, something that can figure out values that
  havn't be used would be nice as well

  Suggestion:
    read_int("name", name, "Error Message")

* some people like auto-scrolling in window mode, in 0.6.0 it worked
  even when completly out of the window, in SDL the mouse coords don't
  get updated when the mouse isn't in the window (need to switch from
  event to polling?!)

* action-axis doesn't handle analog (do we even need this or could we do with axis-button?)

* remove SceneContext from Credits, replace with DrawingContext

* add drag&drop scrolling

* nuke button is unclean, other buttons not so great either -> repaint


Roadmap for Pingus Editor 0.7.3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Important:
==========

* remove support for obsolete tags: 

  - liquid/speed
  - hotpost/speed
  - hotpost/parallax (replace with para-x, para-y)

* Pack some new levels: indiana


Medium Important:
=================

* implement proper tmpfile Support (save tmp levels to ~/.pingus/tmp/
  for backup purpose in case of editor crash or so)

* Dialogs: Editor Properties: user name and email

* show an error message if save fails


Less Important:
===============

* add ability to scale surfaces to the level editor and level format

* keyboard shortcuts need to be implemented with input framework, but
  how without support for keymaps?

* add type conversion (important to convert groundpieces in hotspots and visa verse)

* add options to show/hide hidden files and filter stuff

* could/should rotate around object center

* write a color select widget (Hue, Saturation.Value)


Older Stuff:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* seperate colmap and gfx remover surfaces for digger, miner, etc. would be nice
  the current ones don't work very good since the remove path is too smooth
  - keep_trans,alpha blitters would also be very nice (darken the border of a digging path or something like that)

* fix author in all levels

* update email addrs and missing author fields in level files

* add better load-from-file support for hotspots, backgrounds, etc.

* pingus doesn't die when out-of-screen

* Floaters shouldn't float until they've fallen the minimum distance
  it'd take for a regular Pingu to splat. That way, you wouldn't have to
  worry about floaters moving so slowly a lot of the time, when
  unnecessary

* All entrances should have graphics and be animated

* Bridgers seem to move backwards when they first start stacking (I
  think that their graphic may be more to the left in its square than
  the walker graphic, and also a little smaller than the walker
  graphic - probably because it's confined to a square of the same
  size - maybe give special workers slightly larger graphic sizes, so
  they can appear to be the same size as walkers)

* In space levels, Pingu that fall off of a cliff into space don't
  die, though they should just like in water or lava.


Missing Groundpieces
====================

Sortie Theme:
 - this theme needs 'normal' groundpieces which can be used to dig
   throught and things like that, it currently only has horizontal and
   vertical bars, which make building levels quite difficult


Other Wishes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Water, Lava, Snake, Spike, Electric pits
* Cursor follow mode
* Pingus able to swim

> Man koennte Tueren, Treppen, Bruecken, Lifte, Teleporter...
> einbauen ("Extra pingu actions"), die sich auf konventionelle
> Weise nicht oeffnen/begehen/ausfahren/aktivieren lassen, sondern
> erst durch einen "Hacker-Pingu" freigeschaltet werden muessen,
> der sich an einem nahegelegenen Terminal an die Arbeit macht. Um
