# Week-1 (25/05--31/05)

## What I was supposed to do the past week?

First week of the project.

## What I actually did the past week?

I've converted .jpg to .png and .it to .wav.

I've fixed fade_over(), at least it looks like a transition effect now.

Added C++-to-Ceu proxy events and a few Ceu classes which react to those.

Ported some mouse reacting behavior of MenuButton, ArmageddonButton and 
ForwardButton.

## What I'll do this week?

Start porting Pingus?
Falling, normal walk, maybe digging?
