tinygettext
===========

tinygettext is a minimal gettext() replacement written in C++. It can
read .po files directly and doesn't need .mo files generated from .po.
It also can read the .po files from arbitary locations, so its much
better suited for non-Unix systems and situations in which one wants
to store or distrubite .po files seperatly from the software itself.



Detecting the locale setting
============================

Different operating systems store the default locale in different
places; a portable way to find it is provided by FindLocale:
