Properties: floater, climber
Actions:    bomber, jumber, blocker, miner, digger, basher, bridger

Floater:
~~~~~~~~ 
If the pingu is starting to falling, then he uses his propeller to
limit his falling speed 

Climber:
~~~~~~~~
If the pingu hits a verticall wall, he dosn't revert the direction,
instead he starts to walk onto the wall.

Bomber:
~~~~~~~
Starts a count down of 5 secs and than expoledes the pingu.

Jumper:
~~~~~~~
Accelerate the pingu in an angle of pi/4 (45 degrees). 

Blocker:
~~~~~~~~
Reverses the direction of every pingu, which came relativly close to a
blocker. The action will be stopped if the pingu is no longer standing
on the ground.

Digger:
~~~~~~~
Starts to dig into the ground, if the pingu its the air (at least 8
pixels should be air.

Basher:
~~~~~~~
Starts to do a forward dig into the ground. It should at least to a
circular dig. If he hits some air (don't know how much) the action is
stopped.

Bridger:
~~~~~~~~
Starts to build blocks in an angle of probably ~30 degrees. If his
head hits the roof he stopps, if he is out of blocks he stopps. If he
stopps he waits some secs before he starts to walk again.
